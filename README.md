# Zomato Clone Backend üçî 

This backend is part of the Zomato Clone project, designed to manage food donations and requests. It provides an efficient server-side application for handling user authentication, CRUD operations for food items, donation requests, and role-based access control.

## üöÄ Project Overview
The Zomato Clone Backend enables users to manage food donations and requests in a secure environment. It allows users to create, update, and delete food items, search for food by name, and request donations. The platform supports role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can manage donations. The backend also implements secure authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and stores sensitive data using cookies.

This backend is connected to a frontend hosted at [Zomato Clone](https://zomato-37f5f.web.app), providing a complete end-to-end solution for food donation management.

- **CORS**: For handling cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables and sensitive data.

## üì¶ NPM Packages Used
- `express` - Web framework for Node.js.
- `jsonwebtoken` - For creating and verifying JWT tokens.
- `cookie-parser` - For parsing cookies to handle JWT tokens.
- `cors` - For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- `dotenv` - For managing environment variables.
- `mongodb` - MongoDB driver for interacting with the database.
